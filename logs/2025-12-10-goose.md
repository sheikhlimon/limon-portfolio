## Project

[Goose](https://github.com/block/goose) - A local, extensible, open source AI agent that automates engineering tasks.

## Overview

I contributed to Goose, a production-grade AI agent written primarily in Rust. I picked up Rust in practice while contributing. Goose is not only an AI agent but also a Rust-based project that supports building and coding with AI assistance. By using AI agents as a pair programmer, I was able to learn the codebase and contribute meaningful changes to a complex system.

## Contributions

I submitted multiple pull requests to Goose, all of which were reviewed and merged.

Notable contributions:

- **macOS keychain infinite prompt loop fix** ([#6620](https://github.com/block/goose/pull/6620)) – Added in-memory cache to eliminate repeated keychain prompts
- **MCP hermit cleanup path expansion** ([#5953](https://github.com/block/goose/pull/5953)) – Fixed path resolution issues
- **Graceful keyring failure fallback** ([#5808](https://github.com/block/goose/pull/5808)) – Improved CLI error handling
- **Unified style checks** ([#5650](https://github.com/block/goose/pull/5650)) – Added a check-everything command for consistent code quality
- **Session management fixes** ([#5644](https://github.com/block/goose/pull/5644)) – Prevented repeated 404 errors for deleted sessions
- **Context menu fixes** ([#5616](https://github.com/block/goose/pull/5616)) – Restored standard right-click menu behavior
- **JSON output format support** ([#5525](https://github.com/block/goose/pull/5525)) – Added the `--output-format json` flag to `goose run`
- **Husky prepare script update** ([#5522](https://github.com/block/goose/pull/5522)) – Updated the project to Husky v9 format

My contributions ranged from CLI improvements and session management to style enforcement. Some work also involved TypeScript and React for frontend and API-related issues.
